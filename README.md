Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

- The client is The Gaming Room who has tasked me with desining a game called 'Draw It or Lose It'. The requirments of the software include running on multiple platforms, allow for multiple teams with multiple users assigned to them, only one instance of a game is allowed to run, and each team is allowed a unique name.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

-In the documentation I was able to write the executive summary, requirments, and design constraints really well. I also did well on the evaluation section for the server side, client side, and development tools.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

- Creating the design restraints and requirments, as well as an executive summary worked as a guide to move the code in the correct direction.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

-I would revise the reccomendation section of the document. I only did a basic reccomendation of only one item in each section without going into deep detail of the main reasons for reccomendation. An example would be to use cloud storage and list the benefits, but failed to reccomend an actual cloud based company and their benefits.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

-I interpret the user's needs as the user's perspective. To me the software designer I may see features of a product that I believe may be useless or very important, but to the user it can be the complete oposite. It is important to see what is important to the users, while designing its best to create what is important to the users and not what the company believes is important.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

-I approach designing software by first getting a summary of what the client is asking for. Next is to list all requirments and constrants for the product. Before coding a domain model is needed to create a map to follow and not stray from the main requirments. For future software applications I would follow this set of steps, I believe the prep and set up before hand is the most important thing to do before jumping straight into coding.
